# &#35; user mail
we used [modoboa](https://modoboa.org/) - made multidomain email hosting simple

|  |  |
| ------------------------- |:---:|
| webmail:                  | [https://mail.envs.net](https://mail.envs.net/) |
| username:                 | username@envs.net |
|  |  |
| smtp server-address:      | mail.envs.net |
| smtp server-address:      | 587 |
| smtp connection-security: | STARTTLS |
|  |  |
| imap server-address:      | mail.envs.net |
| imap server-port:         | 143 |
| imap connection-security: | STARTTLS |
|  |  |
| pop server-address:       | mail.envs.net |
| pop server-port:          | 110 |
| pop connection-security:  | STARTTLS |

you can find more mail settings directly in you're [webmail](https://mail.envs.net/user/#profile/).<br />
(*an secondary e-mail address, can be used for recovery needs*)

we also have managesieve support. managesieve is available on the default port (4190)

if you want to use an external managesieve client (like the [thunderbird add-on](https://github.com/thsmi/sieve)).<br />
you can also set up your filter in the [webmailer](https://mail.envs.net/sfilters/).
